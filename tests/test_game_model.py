test_game_model.py

This test suite verifies the behavior of game objects defined in game_model.py.

The focus is on testing:
- Proper instantiation and attribute handling of characters and subclasses
- Health system logic (including healing with potions and health clamping)
- Pouch and inventory behavior
- Special object behaviors (e.g., treasure chest, potion usage)
